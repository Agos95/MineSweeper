# Minesweeper

Minesweeper implemetation in different programming languages.

This is just a small project to start to learn different programming languages.
The reason behind the choice of Minesweeper is that the game is not too hard, but it is also not trivial. In addition, it can be implemented in diffirent way, such as:
- *base* version: terminal application, where the grid is reprinted every time a move is selected;
- *TUI* version: terminal application, but interactive (eg. using `curses`)
- *GUI* version: graphical and interactive application

The first implementation will be in Python, since it is the programming language I am most familiar with. 
Below there is the list of programming languages I would like to try:

- [ ] Python (base)
- [ ] Python (TUI)
- [ ] Python (GUI)
- [ ] C++ (?)
- [ ] Go (?)
- [ ] Javascript (GUI in Browser)
- [ ] Java (GUI)
- [ ] Lua (?)
