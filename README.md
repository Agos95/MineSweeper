# Minesweeper

Minesweeper implemetation in different programming languages.

This is just a small project to start to learn different programming languages. 
The first implementation will be in Python (first in the terminal, then using GUI), since it is the programming language I am most familiar with.
The idea is to replicate the code using:

- [ ] Python (Terminal)
- [ ] Python (GUI)
- [ ] C++ (Terminal)
- [ ] Go (Terminal)
- [ ] Javascript (Browser)
- [ ] Java (GUI)
- [ ] Lua
